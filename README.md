This is a project that I would like to use in order to learn all the necessary skills of web-design such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and possible more. The project centers around the creation of pretty pictures by continued application of a certain function to an initial complex number (e.g. z -> log(1+z) -> log(1+log(1+z)) -> ...). If this sequence converges, the angle of the limit can be displayed via colorcoding and thus the limits of the map applied to a subsection of the complex plane generates a picture.

The homepage that I am trying to design here shall
1) show some of the pictures/walks/zooms etc. that I create
2) explain how its done mathematically and numerically
3) give the ability to upvote on pictures with a logging system in place
4) from the viewer feedback train a classification model that can predict which map creates pretty pictures
5) let users create their own pictures/walks/zooms via a webinterface
6) let users display their results and have them be voted on as well
7) more stuff that I cannot think of right now :)
